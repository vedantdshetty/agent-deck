# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Deck will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Per-group Claude config overrides (`[groups."<name>".claude]`). (Base implementation by @alec-pinson in [PR #578](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/pull/578))
- In-product feedback feature: CLI `agent-deck feedback`, TUI `Ctrl+E`, three-tier submit (GraphQL, clipboard, browser).

### Fixed
- Session persistence: tmux servers now survive SSH logout on Linux+systemd hosts via `launch_in_user_scope` default (v1.5.2 hotfix). ([docs/SESSION-PERSISTENCE-SPEC.md](docs/SESSION-PERSISTENCE-SPEC.md))
- Custom-command Claude sessions (conductors) now resume from latest JSONL on restart.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-16

v1.6.0 is the Watcher Framework milestone. Event-driven automation via five adapter types (webhook, ntfy, GitHub, Slack, Gmail), a self-improving routing engine, health alerts bridge, and conductor-style on-disk layout.

### Added
- **Watcher engine** — event-driven automation framework with five adapters (webhook, ntfy, GitHub, Slack, Gmail), SQLite-backed dedup, HMAC-SHA256 verification, and self-improving routing via triage sessions. See `internal/watcher/`.
- **Watcher health alerts bridge** — opt-in `[watcher.alerts]` config block wires engine health state to Telegram/Slack/Discord with per-(watcher x trigger) 15-minute debounce. See `internal/watcher/health_bridge.go`. Closes REQ-WF-3.
- **Watcher folder hierarchy** — on-disk state reorganized to `~/.agent-deck/watcher/` (singular) mirroring the conductor folder pattern. Shared files (CLAUDE.md, POLICY.md, LEARNINGS.md, clients.json) at root, per-watcher subdirs (meta.json, state.json, task-log.md). Closes REQ-WF-6.
- **Per-watcher health fields** — `agent-deck watcher list --json` now exposes `last_event_ts`, `error_count`, `health_status` per watcher.
- **Watcher CLI** — 8 subcommands: create, start, stop, status, list, logs, import, install-skill.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Watcher data directory renamed** — `~/.agent-deck/watchers/` is now `~/.agent-deck/watcher/` (singular). A compatibility symlink `watchers -> watcher/` is created automatically on first boot so existing scripts continue to work. The symlink will be removed in v1.7.0. Update any hardcoded paths.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-10

v1.5.0 is the Premium Web App milestone. The web interface gets P0/P1 bug fixes, performance optimization (first-load wire size from 668 KB to under 150 KB gzipped), UX polish, and automated visual regression testing.

### Fixed

- [Phase 6] Mobile hamburger menu clickable at all viewports <=768px with systematic 7-level z-index scale. (WEB-P0-1)
- [Phase 6] Profile switcher: single profile shows read-only label; multi profile shows non-interactive list with help text for CLI switching. (WEB-P0-2)
- [Phase 6] Session title truncation: action buttons use absolute positioning with hover-reveal, no longer reserving 90px of space. (WEB-P0-3)
- [Phase 6] Write-protected mode: mutationsEnabled=false hides all write buttons; toast auto-dismisses at 5s with stack cap of 3 and history drawer for dismissed toasts. (WEB-P0-4, POL-7)
- [Phase 7] Terminal panel fills container on attach, no empty gray space below terminal. (WEB-P1-1)

- [Phase 7] Sidebar row density increased to 40px per row (from ~52px); 20+ sessions visible at 1080p. (WEB-P1-3)
- [Phase 7] Empty-state dashboard uses centered card layout with max-width 1024px. (WEB-P1-4)
- [Phase 7] Mobile topbar overflow menu for controls on viewports <600px. (WEB-P1-5)

### Performance

- [Phase 8] Chart.js script tag deferred to unblock HTML parser. (PERF-B)
- [Phase 8] xterm canvas addon removed (dead code); fallback chain is now WebGL then DOM only. (PERF-C)
- [Phase 8] WebGL addon lazy-loaded on desktop only; mobile skips import entirely, saving 126 KB. (PERF-D)
- [Phase 8] Event listener leak fixed via AbortController; listener count at rest drops from 290 to ~50. (PERF-E)
- [Phase 8] Search input debounced at 250ms; typing lag drops from 33ms to <8ms. (PERF-F)
- [Phase 8] SessionRow memoized; group collapse no longer rerenders 152 unrelated components. (PERF-G)
- [Phase 8] ES modules bundled via esbuild with code splitting and cache-busted filenames. (PERF-H)
- [Phase 8] Cost batch endpoint converted from GET to POST, preventing 414 URI Too Long. (PERF-I)
- [Phase 8] Immutable cache headers on hashed assets (1-year max-age). (PERF-J)
- [Phase 8] SessionList virtualized for 50+ sessions via hand-rolled useVirtualList hook. (PERF-K)

- [Phase 10] Weekly regression alerting workflow: runs visual + Lighthouse, posts issue on failure. (TEST-E)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Restore TUI keyboard input on all terminals (iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm, Kitty, tmux). Arrow keys, j/k, and mouse scroll were broken in v1.4.1 because `CSIuReader` wrapping `os.Stdin` made Bubble Tea skip raw-mode setup (`tcsetattr`), leaving the TTY in cooked mode and echoing escape sequences as text. Fixes #539, #544. ([#541](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/pull/541))
- Fix CSI final-byte whitelist in `csiuReader.translate` to include SGR mouse terminators (`M`/`m`), so mouse events are no longer corrupted when the reader is used. ([#541](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/pull/541))
- Remove `EnableKittyKeyboard(os.Stdout)` / `DisableKittyKeyboard(os.Stdout)` pairs from all four attach paths (`attachCmd`, `remoteCreateAndAttachCmd`, `attachWindowCmd`, `remoteAttachCmd`) in `internal/ui/home.go`. Writing `ESC[>1u` to the outer terminal before `tmux attach` put Ghostty (and other kitty-protocol terminals) into CSI u mode; tmux could not translate these sequences for the inner application, causing arrow keys to appear as raw escape codes. Restores v0.28.3 attach behavior. Fixes #546. ([#547](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/pull/547))

### Added
- Integration tests for TUI keyboard input (`internal/integration/tui_input_test.go`) to prevent future regressions in raw-mode setup and CSI handling.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Expose custom tools in the Settings panel default-tool picker so configured tools can be selected without editing `config.toml` by hand.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Add `preview.show_notes` support so the notes section can be hidden from the preview pane while keeping the main session view intact.
- Add Gemini hook management commands and hook-based Gemini session/status sync, including install, uninstall, and status flows.
- Add remote-session lifecycle actions in the TUI so remote sessions can be restarted, closed, or deleted directly from the session list.
- Add richer Slack bridge context so forwarded messages include stable sender/channel enrichment.

### Fixed
- Preserve hook-derived session identity across empty hook payloads by persisting a read-time session-id anchor fallback.
- Improve Telegram bot mention stripping and username handling so bridge messages route more reliably in group chats.
- Avoid repeated regexp compilation in hot paths by hoisting `regexp.MustCompile` calls to package-level variables.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Restore instant preview rendering from cached content during session navigation and immediately after returning from an attached session, removing placeholder delays introduced in `0.24.0`.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Add `internal/send` package consolidating all send verification functions (prompt detection, composer parsing, unsent-prompt checks) into a single location.
- Add Codex readiness detection: `waitForAgentReady` and `sendMessageWhenReady` now gate on `codex>` prompt before delivering messages to Codex sessions.
- Add session death detection in `--wait` mode: `waitForCompletion` detects 5 consecutive status errors and returns exit code 1 instead of hanging indefinitely.
- Add heartbeat migration function (`MigrateConductorHeartbeatScripts`) that auto-refreshes installed scripts to the latest template.
- Add exit 137 (SIGKILL) investigation report documenting root cause as Claude Code limitation with reproduction steps and mitigation strategies.
- Add exit 137 mitigation guidance to shared conductor CLAUDE.md and GSD conductor SKILL.md.
- Promote 27 validated conductor learnings to shared docs: 10 universal orchestration patterns to conductor CLAUDE.md, 6 GSD-specific learnings to gsd-conductor SKILL.md, 11 operational patterns to agent-deck-workflow SKILL.md.

### Fixed
- Harden Enter retry loop: retry every iteration for first 5 attempts (previously every 3rd), increasing ambiguous budget from 2 to 4.
- Scope heartbeat scripts to conductor's own group instead of broadcasting to all sessions in the profile.
- Honor `heartbeat_interval = 0` as disabled: skip heartbeat daemon installation during conductor setup.
- Add enabled-status guard to heartbeat scripts so they exit silently when conductor is disabled.
- Fix `-c` and `-g` flag co-parsing so both flags work together in `agent-deck add`.
- Improve `--no-parent` help text to reference `set-parent` for later parent linking.

### Changed
- Clean up all six conductor LEARNINGS.md files: mark promoted entries, remove retired entries, consolidate duplicates.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Add status detection integration tests: real tmux status transition cycles, pattern detection, and tool config verification.
- Add conductor pipeline integration tests: send-to-child delivery, cross-session event write-watch, heartbeat round-trips, and chunked send delivery.
- Add edge case integration tests: skills discover-attach verification.
- Complete milestone v1.1 Integration Testing (38 integration tests across 6 phases).

### Fixed
- Handle nested binary paths in release tarballs so self-update works with both flat and directory-wrapped archives.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Add integration test framework: TmuxHarness (auto-cleanup real tmux sessions), polling helpers (WaitForCondition, WaitForPaneContent, WaitForStatus), and SQLite fixture helpers (NewTestDB, InstanceBuilder).
- Add session lifecycle integration tests (start, stop, fork, restart) using real tmux sessions with automatic cleanup.
- Add session lifecycle unit tests covering start, stop, fork, and attach operations with tmux verification.
- Add status lifecycle tests for sleep/wake detection and SQLite persistence round-trips.
- Add skills runtime tests verifying on-demand skill loading, pool skill discovery, and project skill application.

### Changed
- Reformat agent-deck and session-share SKILL.md files to official Anthropic skill-creator format with proper frontmatter.
- Add $SKILL_DIR path resolution to session-share skill for plugin cache compatibility.
- Register session-share skill in marketplace.json for independent discoverability.
- Update GSD conductor skill content in pool directory with current lifecycle documentation.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Propagate forked `AGENTDECK_INSTANCE_ID` values correctly so Claude hook subprocesses update the child session instead of the parent.
- Fully honor `[tmux].inject_status_line = false` by skipping tmux notification/status-line mutations when status injection is disabled.
- Add Gemini `--yolo` CLI overrides for `agent-deck add`, `agent-deck session start`, and TUI session creation.
- Clamp final TUI frames to the terminal viewport so navigation cannot spill duplicate footer/help rows into scrollback.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Add built-in Pi tool support, configurable hotkeys, session notes in the preview pane, and optional follow-CWD-on-attach behavior in the TUI.
- Add OpenClaw gateway integration with sync, status, list, send, and bridge commands for managing OpenClaw agents as agent-deck sessions.
- Add per-window tmux tracking in the session list with direct window navigation and AI tool badges.
- Add remote session creation from the TUI (`n`/`N` on remote groups and remote sessions).
- Add remote binary management with automatic install during `agent-deck remote add` and the new `agent-deck remote update` command.
- Add configurable `[worktree].branch_prefix` for new worktree sessions.
- Add Vimium-style jump mode for session-list navigation.

### Changed

- Significantly reduce TUI lag during navigation, attach/return flows, preview rendering, and background status refreshes.

### Fixed

- Enable Claude-specific session management features for custom tools that wrap the `claude` binary.
- Prevent non-interactive installs from hanging when `tmux` is missing by skipping interactive prompts and failing fast when `sudo` would block.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Recover automatically when tmux startup fails due to a stale/unreachable default socket by quarantining the stale socket and retrying session creation once. This prevents `failed to create tmux session ... server exited unexpectedly` startup failures.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Add Discord bot support to the conductor bridge with setup flow and config support (`[conductor.discord]`), including slash commands (`/ad-status`, `/ad-sessions`, `/ad-restart`, `/ad-help`) and heartbeat alert delivery to Discord.

### Changed

- Reduce tmux `%output`-driven status update frequency for chatty sessions to lower parsing overhead and smooth CPU usage under heavy output.

### Fixed

- Restrict Discord slash commands to the configured Discord channel so conductor control stays channel-scoped.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- Add remote SSH session support with two workflows:
  - `agent-deck add --ssh <user@host> [--remote-path <path>]` to launch/manage sessions on remote hosts.
  - `agent-deck remote add/list/sessions/attach/rename` to manage and interact with remote agent-deck instances.
- Add remote sessions to the TUI under `remotes/<name>`, with keyboard attach (`Enter`) and rename (`r`) support.
- Add JSON session fields `ssh_host` and `ssh_remote_path` in `agent-deck list --json` output.

### Fixed

- Recover repository state after the broken PR #260 merge and re-apply the feature cleanly on `main`.
- Harden SSH command handling by shell-quoting remote command parts and SSH host/path values.
- Prevent remote name parsing collisions by rejecting `:` in remote names.
- Preserve full multi-word titles in `agent-deck remote rename`.
- Stabilize remote session rendering order and snapshot-copy remote data during TUI rebuilds for safer async updates.

## [0.19.19] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Make Homebrew update installs resilient to stale local tap metadata by running `brew update` before `brew upgrade` in `agent-deck update`.
- Update Homebrew check/install guidance to show the full install command (`brew update && brew upgrade asheshgoplani/tap/agent-deck`) so users can copy-paste a working path directly.

## [0.19.18] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Make `agent-deck update` Homebrew-aware end-to-end: `--check` now shows the correct `brew upgrade` command and interactive install can execute the Homebrew upgrade path directly instead of failing after confirmation.
- Harden conductor/daemon binary resolution to prefer the active executable path and robust PATH ordering, avoiding stale `/usr/local/bin` picks that could drop parent transition notifications.
- Prevent TUI freezes during create/fork worktree flows by moving worktree creation into async command execution instead of blocking the Enter key handler.
- Enforce Claude conversation ID deduplication on storage saves (CLI + TUI paths) so duplicate `claude_session_id` ownership does not persist, with deterministic older-session retention.

### Changed

- Add conductor permission-loop troubleshooting guidance (`allow_dangerous_mode` / `dangerous_mode`) in README and troubleshooting docs.

## [0.19.17] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Add Docker sandbox mode for sessions (TUI + CLI), including per-session containers, hardened container defaults, and sandbox docs/config references.

### Fixed

- Preserve non-sandbox tmux startup behavior while keeping sandbox dead-pane restart support.
- Strengthen `session send --no-wait` / launch no-wait initial-message delivery with retry+verification to reduce dropped prompt submits.
- Route transition notifications through explicit parent linkage only (no conductor fallback), and align conductor/README guidance with parent-linked routing.

## [0.19.16] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Restore OpenCode/Codex status detection for active output by matching both `status_details` and `status` fields in tmux JSON pane formats.
- Eliminate a worktree creation TOCTOU race in `add` by creating/checking candidate worktree paths in one flow and retrying with suffixed names when collisions happen.
- Avoid false Claude tool detection for shell wrappers by validating shell executables exactly and only classifying wrappers as Claude when `claude` appears as a command token.
- Resolve duplicate group-name move failures in the TUI by moving sessions using canonical group paths while preserving user-facing group labels.

## [0.19.15] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Add soft-select path editing and filterable recent-path suggestions in the New Session dialog, including matching-count hints and focused keyboard help text.
- Add compact notifications mode (`[notifications].minimal = true`) with status icon/count summary in tmux status-left, including `starting` sessions in the active count.
- Add conductor heartbeat rules externalization via `HEARTBEAT_RULES.md` (global default plus per-profile override support in the bridge runtime).
- Add proactive conductor context management with `clear_on_compact` controls (`conductor setup --no-clear-on-compact` and per-conductor metadata) and synchronous `PreCompact` hook registration.

### Fixed

- Preserve ANSI color/styling in session preview rendering while keeping status/readiness parsing reliable by normalizing ANSI where plain-text matching is required.
- Restore original tmux `status-left` correctly when clearing notifications, including intentionally empty original values.
- Guard analytics cache map access across UI and background worker paths to avoid concurrent map read/write races during background status updates.
- Prevent self-update prompts/flows on Homebrew-managed installs.

## [0.19.14] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Add automatic heartbeat script migration for existing conductors so managed `heartbeat.sh` files are refreshed to the current generated template during conductor migration checks.
- Add `--cmd` parsing support for tool commands with inline args in `add`/`launch` (for example `-c "codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox"`), with automatic wrapper generation when needed.

### Fixed

- Switch generated conductor heartbeat sends to non-blocking `session send --no-wait -q`, eliminating recurring `agent not ready after 80 seconds` timeout churn for busy conductors.
- Improve `add`/`launch` CLI help and JSON output to expose resolved command/wrapper details and avoid confusing launch behavior when mixing tool names with extra args.
- Fix parent/group friction for conductor-launched sessions by allowing explicit `-g/--group` to override inherited parent group while keeping parent linkage for notifications.

### Changed

- Expand README and CLI reference guidance for conductor-launched sessions (`--no-parent` vs auto-parent), transition notifier behavior, and safe command patterns.

## [0.19.13] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Add built-in event-driven transition notifications (`notify-daemon`) that nudge a parent session first, then fall back to a conductor session when a child transitions from `running` to `waiting`/`error`/`idle`.
- Add `--no-parent` and default auto-parent linking for `add`/`launch` when launched from a managed session (`AGENT_DECK_SESSION_ID`), with conflict protection for `--parent` + `--no-parent`.
- Add `parent_session_id` and `parent_project_path` to `agent-deck session show --json`.
- Add conductor setup/status/teardown integration for the transition notifier daemon so always-on notifications can be installed and managed with conductor commands.

### Fixed

- Reduce SQLite lock contention under concurrent daemon and CLI usage by avoiding unnecessary schema-version writes and retrying transient busy errors during storage migration/open.
- Improve status-driven notification reliability for fast tool completions by combining watcher updates with direct hook-file fallback reads and hook-based terminal transition candidates.

## [0.19.11] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- Add shared and per-conductor `LEARNINGS.md` support with setup/migration wiring so conductors can capture reusable orchestration lessons over time.

### Fixed

- Harden `launch -m` and `session send` message delivery for Claude by using fresh pane captures, robust composer prompt parsing (including wrapped prompts), and stronger Enter retry verification to avoid pasted-but-unsent prompts.
- Improve readiness detection for non-Claude tools (including Codex) by treating stable `idle`/`waiting` states as ready, preventing false startup timeouts when launching with an initial message.
- Fix launch/session-start messaging semantics so non-`--no-wait` flows correctly report message sent state (`message_pending=false`).

## [0.19.10] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Make `agent-deck session send --wait` and `agent-deck session output` resilient when Claude session IDs are missing/stale by using best-effort response recovery (tmux env refresh, disk sync fallback, and terminal parse fallback).
- Improve Claude send verification to catch pasted-but-unsent prompts even after an initial `waiting` state, reducing false positives where a prompt was pasted but never submitted.
- Update conductor bridge messaging to use single-call `session send --wait -q --timeout ...` flow for Telegram/Slack and heartbeat handling, reducing extra polling steps and improving reliability.
- Reject non-directory legacy file skills when attaching project skills, and harden skill materialization to recover from broken symlinks and symlinked target-path edge cases.

### Changed

- Update conductor templates/docs and launcher helper scripts to prefer one-shot launch/send flows and single-call wait semantics for smoother orchestration.

## [0.19.9] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Fix terminal style leakage after tmux attach by waiting for PTY output to drain and resetting OSC-8/SGR styles before the TUI redraws.
- Harden `agent-deck session send` delivery by retrying `Enter` only when Claude shows a pasted-but-unsent marker (`[Pasted text ...]`) and avoiding unnecessary retries once status is already `waiting`/`idle`.

### Changed

- Clarify tmux wait-bar shortcut docs: press `Ctrl+b`, release, then press `1`–`6` to jump to waiting sessions.

## [0.19.8] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Fix `agent-deck session show --json` MCP output marshalling by emitting concrete local/global/project values instead of a method reference in `mcps.local` (#213).
- Fix conductor daemon Python resolution by preferring `python3` from the active shell `PATH` before fallback absolute paths (#215).

## [0.19.7] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Fix heartbeat script profile text stamping so generated `heartbeat.sh` uses the real profile name in message text for non-default profiles (#207, contributed by @CoderNoveau).
- Fix conductor bridge message delivery when the conductor session is idle by using non-blocking `session send --no-wait`, and apply this in the embedded runtime bridge template with regression coverage (#210, contributed by @sjoeboo).

## [0.19.6] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Add `manage_mcp_json` config option to disable all `.mcp.json` writes, plus a LOCAL-scope MCP Manager warning when disabled (#197, contributed by @sjoeboo).
- Split conductor guidance into shared mechanism (`CLAUDE.md`) and policy (`POLICY.md`) with per-conductor policy override support (#201).

### Fixed

- Fix conductor setup migration so legacy generated per-conductor `CLAUDE.md` files are updated safely for the policy split while preserving custom and symlinked files (#201).
- Fix launchd and systemd conductor daemon units to include the installed `agent-deck` binary directory in `PATH` so bridge/heartbeat jobs can find the CLI (#196, contributed by @sjoeboo).
- Support environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `${VAR}`) in path-based config values and unify path expansion behavior across config consumers (#194, contributed by @tiwillia).

## [0.19.5] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Remap TUI shortcuts to reduce conflicts: `m` opens MCP Manager, `s` opens Skills Manager (Claude), and `M` moves sessions between groups.

### Fixed

- Reduce Codex session watcher CPU usage by rate-limiting expensive on-disk session scans and avoiding redundant tmux environment writes.
- Fix macOS installer crash on default Bash 3.2 by replacing associative arrays in `install.sh` with Bash 3.2 compatible helper functions (#192, contributed by @slkiser).

## [0.19.4] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Add pool-focused type-to-jump navigation and scrolling in the Skills Manager (`P`) dialog for long lists.
- Add stricter Skills Manager available list behavior so project attach/detach is driven by the managed pool source.

### Changed

- Update README and skill references with Skills Manager usage, skill CLI command coverage, and skills registry path documentation.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Add `agent-deck web` mode to run the TUI and web UI server together, with browser terminal streaming and session menu APIs (#174, contributed by @PatrickStraeter)

- Add macOS MacPorts support to `install.sh` with `--pkg-manager` selection alongside Homebrew (#187, contributed by @bronweg)

### Fixed

- Fix `allow_dangerous_mode` propagation for Claude sessions created from the UI flow (#185, contributed by @daniel-shimon)
- Fix TUI scroll artifacts caused by width-measurement inconsistency and control-character leakage in preview rendering (#182, contributed by @jsvana)
- Fix Claude busy-pattern false positives from welcome-banner separators by anchoring spinner regexes to line start (#179, contributed by @mtparet)
- Harden web mode by restricting WebSocket upgrades to same-host origins and preserving auth token in push deep links (#174)

## [0.18.1] - 2026-02-17

- Existing sessions without hooks continue using polling (seamless hybrid mode)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

### Added

- Add `allow_dangerous_mode` option to `[claude]` config section
  - Passes `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` to Claude (opt-in bypass mode)
  - `dangerous_mode = true` takes precedence when both are set
  - Based on contribution by @daniel-shimon (#152), with architectural fixes (#153)
- New permission flag persists per-session across fork and restart operations

## [0.11.3] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- Fix deleted sessions reappearing after reload or app restart
  - `SaveInstances()` now deletes stale rows from SQLite within the same transaction
  - Added explicit `DeleteInstance()` call in the delete handler as a safeguard
  - Root cause: `INSERT OR REPLACE` never removed deleted session rows from the database
- Update profile detection to check for `state.db` (SQLite) in addition to legacy `sessions.json`
- Update uninstall script to count sessions from SQLite instead of JSON

### Added

- Persist UI state (cursor position, preview mode, status filter) across restarts via SQLite metadata

- Update troubleshooting docs for SQLite-based recovery

## [0.11.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Enable notification bar on all instances, not just the primary
  - Previously secondary instances had notifications disabled entirely
  - All instances share the same SQLite state, so they produce identical bar content

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Replace file-based lock with SQLite heartbeat-based primary election for multi-instance coordination
  - Dynamic failover: if the primary instance crashes, a secondary takes over the notification bar within ~12 seconds
  - Eliminates stale `.lock` files that required manual cleanup after crashes
  - `ElectPrimary()` uses atomic SQLite transactions to prevent split-brain

### Removed

- Remove `acquireLock`, `releaseLock`, `getLockFilePath`, `isProcessRunning` (replaced by SQLite election)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Replace `sessions.json` with SQLite (`state.db`) as the single source of truth
  - WAL mode for concurrent multi-instance reads/writes without corruption
  - Auto-migrates existing `sessions.json` on first run (renamed to `.migrated` as backup)
  - Removes fragile full-file JSON rewrites, backup rotation, and fsnotify dependency
  - Tool-specific data stored as JSON blob in `tool_data` column for schema flexibility
- Replace fsnotify-based storage watcher with SQLite metadata polling
  - Simpler, works reliably on all filesystems (9p, NFS, WSL)
  - 2-second poll interval using `metadata.last_modified` timestamp
- Replace tmux rate limiter and watcher with control mode pipes (PipeManager)
  - Event-driven status detection via `tmux -C` control mode
  - Zero-subprocess architecture: no more `tmux capture-pane` for idle sessions

### Added

- Add `internal/statedb` package: SQLite wrapper with CRUD, heartbeat, status sync, and change detection
- Add cross-instance acknowledgment sync via SQLite (ack in instance A visible in instance B)
- Add instance heartbeat table for tracking alive TUI processes
- Add `StatusSettings` in user config (reserved for future status detection settings)

## [0.10.20] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Add `worktree finish` command to merge branch, remove worktree, and delete session in one step (#140)
  - Flags: `--into`, `--no-merge`, `--keep-branch`, `--force`, `--json`
  - Abort-safe: merge conflicts trigger `git merge --abort`, leaving everything intact
- Auto-cleanup worktree directories when deleting worktree sessions (CLI `remove` and TUI `d` key)

### Fixed

- Fix orphaned MCP server processes (Playwright CPU leak) by killing entire process group
  - Set `Setpgid=true` so grandchild processes (npx/uvx spawned) share a process group
  - Shutdown now sends SIGTERM/SIGKILL to `-pid` (group) instead of just the parent
- Fix test cleanup killing user sessions with "test" in their title
- Fix session rename lost during reload race condition

## [0.10.19] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fix session rename not persisting (#141)
  - `lastLoadMtime` was not updated after saves, causing mtime check to incorrectly abort subsequent saves
  - Renames, reorders, and other non-force saves now persist correctly

## [0.10.18] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- Add Codex CLI `--yolo` flag support (#142)
  - Global config: `[codex] yolo_mode = true` in config.toml
  - Per-session override in New Session dialog (checkbox)
  - Flag preserved across session restarts
  - Settings panel toggle for global default
- Add unified `OptionsPanel` interface for tool-specific options (#143)
  - New tools can add options by implementing interface + 1 case in `updateToolOptions()`
  - Shared `renderCheckboxLine()` helper ensures visual consistency across panels

### Fixed

- Fix `ClaudeOptionsPanel.Blur()` not resetting focus state
  - `IsFocused()` now correctly returns false after blur

## [0.10.17] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fix sessions disappearing after creation in TUI
  - Critical saves (create, fork, delete, restore) now bypass mtime check that was incorrectly aborting saves
  - Sessions created during reload are now properly persisted to JSON before triggering reload
- Fix import function to recover orphaned agent-deck sessions
  - Press `i` to import sessions that exist in tmux but are missing from sessions.json
  - Recovered sessions are placed in a "Recovered" group for easy identification

## [0.10.16] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fix garbled input at update confirmation prompt
  - Add `drainStdin()` to flush terminal input buffer before prompting
  - Use `TCFLSH` ioctl to discard pending escape sequences and accidental keypresses
  - Switch from `fmt.Scanln` to `bufio.NewReader` for more robust input handling

## [0.10.15] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fix TUI overwriting CLI changes to sessions.json (#139)
  - Add mtime check before save: compares file mtime against when we last loaded, aborts save and triggers reload if external changes detected
  - Fix TOCTOU race condition: `isReloading` flag now protected by mutex in all 6 read locations
  - Add filesystem detection for WSL2/NFS: warns users when on 9p/NFS/CIFS/SSHFS mounts where fsnotify is unreliable

## [0.10.14] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- Fix critical OOM crash: Global Search was loading 4.4 GB of JSONL content into memory and opening 884 fsnotify directory watchers (7,900+ file descriptors), causing agent-deck to balloon to 6+ GB RSS until macOS killed it
  - Temporarily disable Global Search at startup until memory-safe implementation is complete
  - Optimize directory traversal to skip `tool-results/` and `subagents/` subdirectories (never contain JSONL files)
  - Limit fsnotify watchers to project-level directories only (was recursively watching ALL subdirectories)
- Add max client cap (100) per MCP socket proxy to prevent unbounded goroutine growth from reconnect loops
  - Broken MCPs (e.g., `reddit-yilin` with 72 connects/30s) could spawn unlimited goroutines and scanner buffers

### Changed

- Global Search (`G` key) is temporarily disabled pending a memory-safe reimplementation
  - Will be re-enabled once balanced tier is enforced for large datasets and memory limits are properly applied

## [0.10.13] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- Migrate all logging to structured JSONL via `log/slog` with automatic rotation
  - JSONL output to `~/.agent-deck/debug.log` with component-based filtering (`jq 'select(.component=="pool")'`)
  - Automatic log rotation via lumberjack (configurable size, backups, retention in `[logs]` config)
  - Event aggregation for high-frequency MCP socket events (1 summary per 30s instead of 40 lines/sec)
  - In-memory ring buffer with crash dump support (`kill -USR1 <pid>`)
  - Optional pprof profiling on `localhost:6060`
  - 9 log components: status, mcp, notif, perf, ui, session, storage, pool, http
  - New `[logs]` config options: `debug_level`, `debug_format`, `debug_max_mb`, `debug_backups`, `debug_retention_days`, `debug_compress`, `ring_buffer_mb`, `pprof_enabled`, `aggregate_interval_secs`

### Fixed

- Fix MCP pool infinite restart loop causing 45 GB memory leak over 15 hours
  - Add `StatusPermanentlyFailed` status: broken MCPs are disabled after 10 consecutive failures
  - Fix leaked proxy context/goroutines when `Start()` fails during restart
  - Reset failure counters after proxy is healthy for 5+ minutes (allows transient failure recovery)
  - Skip permanently failed proxies in health monitor for both socket and HTTP pools
- Fix inconsistent debug flag check in tmux.go (`== "1"` changed to `!= ""` to match rest of codebase)

## [0.10.12] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- Fix tmux pane showing stale conversation history after session restart (#138)
  - Clear scrollback buffer before respawn to remove old content
  - Invalidate preview cache on restart for immediate refresh
  - Kill old tmux session in fallback restart path to prevent orphans

## [0.10.11] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- Add `mcp_default_scope` config option to control where MCPs are written (#137)
  - Set to `"global"` or `"user"` to stop agent-deck from overwriting `.mcp.json` on restart
  - Affects MCP Manager default tab, CLI attach/detach defaults, and session restart regeneration
  - Defaults to `"local"` (no breaking change)

## [0.10.10] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- Add configurable worktree path templates via `path_template` config option (#135, contributed by @peteski22)
  - Template variables: `{repo-name}`, `{repo-root}`, `{branch}`, `{session-id}`
  - Overrides `default_location` when set; falls back to existing behavior when unset
  - Integrated at all 4 worktree creation points (CLI add, CLI fork, TUI new session, TUI fork)
  - Backported from [njbrake/agent-of-empires](https://github.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires)

## [0.10.9] - 2026-02-03

### Removed

- Remove dead GoReleaser ldflags targeting non-existent `main.version/commit/date` vars
- Remove redundant `make release` target (superseded by `release-local`)
- Remove unused deprecated wrappers `NewStorage()` and `GetStoragePath()`
- Remove unused test helpers file (`internal/ui/test_helpers.go`)
- Remove stale `home.go.bak` backup file

## [0.10.8] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- Fix shell dying after tool exit by removing `exec` prefix from all tool commands (#133, contributed by @kurochenko)
  - When Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Codex, or generic tools exit, users now return to their shell prompt instead of a dead tmux pane
  - Enables workflows where tools run inside wrappers (e.g., nvim) that should survive tool exit

## [0.10.7] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Add `make release-local` target for local GoReleaser releases (no GitHub Actions dependency)

## [0.10.6] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **TUI freezes with 40+ sessions**: Parallel status polling replaces sequential loop that couldn't complete within 2s tick
  - 10-worker pool via errgroup for concurrent tmux status checks
  - Instance-level RWMutex prevents data races between background worker and TUI rendering
  - Tiered polling skips idle sessions with no activity (10s recheck gate)
  - 3-second timeout on CapturePane/GetWindowActivity prevents hung tmux calls from blocking workers
  - Timeout preserves previous status instead of flashing RED
  - Race detector (`-race`) enabled in tests and CI

## [0.10.5] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Fix intermittent `zsh: killed` due to memory exhaustion (#128)**: Four memory leaks causing macOS OOM killer (Jetsam) to SIGKILL agent-deck after prolonged use with many sessions:
  - Cap global search content buffer memory at 100MB (configurable via `memory_limit_mb`), evict oldest 25% of entries when exceeded
  - Release all content memory and clear file trackers on index Close()
  - Stop debounce timers on watcher shutdown to prevent goroutine leaks
  - Prune stale analytics/activity caches every 20 seconds (were never cleaned up)
  - Clean up analytics caches on session delete
  - Clear orphaned MCP socket proxy request map entries on client disconnect and MCP failure
  - Prune LogWatcher rate limiters for removed sessions every 20 seconds

## [0.10.4] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Prevent nested agent-deck sessions (#127)**: Running `agent-deck` inside a managed tmux session now shows a clear error instead of causing infinite `...` output. Read-only commands (`version`, `help`, `status`, `list`, `session current/show/output`, `mcp list/attached`) still work for debugging

## [0.10.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Global search unusable with large datasets (#125)**: Multiple performance fixes make global search work with multi-GB session data:
  - Remove rate limiter from initial load (was causing 42+ minute "Loading..." on large datasets)
  - Read only first 32KB of files for metadata in balanced tier (was reading entire files, some 800MB+)
  - Early exit from parsing once metadata found (SessionID/CWD/Summary)
  - Parallelize disk search with 8-worker pool (was sequential)
  - Debounced async search on UI thread (250ms debounce + background goroutine)
  - Default `recent_days` to 30 when not set (was 0 = all time)
- **G key didn't open Global Search**: Help bar showed `G Global` but the key actually jumped to the bottom of the list. `G` now opens Global Search (falls back to local search if global search is disabled)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Global search freezes when typing with many sessions (#125)**: Search ran synchronously on the UI thread, blocking all input while scanning files from disk. Now uses debounced async search (250ms debounce + background goroutine) so the UI stays responsive regardless of data size
- **G key didn't open Global Search**: Help bar showed `G Global` but the key actually jumped to the bottom of the list. `G` now opens Global Search (falls back to local search if global search is disabled)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **GREEN status not detecting Claude 2.1.25+ spinners**: Prompt detector only checked braille spinner chars (`⠋⠙⠹...`) as busy guards, missing the asterisk spinners (`✳✽✶✢`) used since Claude 2.1.25. This caused sessions to show YELLOW instead of GREEN while Claude was actively working
- **Prompt detector missing whimsical word timing patterns**: Only "thinking" and "connecting" were recognized as active processing. Now detects all 90+ whimsical words (e.g., "Hullaballooing", "Clauding") via the universal `…` + `tokens` pattern
- **Spinner check range too narrow**: Only checked last 3 lines for spinner chars, but Claude's UI can push the spinner line 6+ lines from the bottom (tip lines, borders, status bar). Expanded to last 10 lines
- **Acknowledge override on attach**: Attaching to a waiting (yellow) session would briefly acknowledge it, but the background poller immediately reset it back to waiting because the prompt was still visible. Prompt detection now respects the acknowledged state

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-02

### Changed

- **Group dialog defaults to root mode on grouped sessions**: Pressing `g` while the cursor is on a session inside a group now opens the "Create New Group" dialog in root mode instead of subgroup mode. Tab toggle still switches to subgroup. Group headers still default to subgroup mode. This makes it easier for users with all sessions in groups to create new root-level groups

### Added

- **MCP socket pool resilience docs**: README updated to mention automatic ~3s crash recovery via reconnecting proxy
- **Pattern override documentation**: `config.toml init` now includes documentation for `busy_patterns_extra`, `prompt_patterns_extra`, and `spinner_chars_extra` fields for extending built-in tool detection patterns

## [0.9.2] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **492% CPU usage**: Main TUI process was consuming 5 CPU cores due to reading 100-841MB JSONL files every 2 seconds per Claude session. Now uses tail-read (last 32KB only) with file-size caching to skip unchanged files entirely
- **Duplicate notification sync**: Both foreground TUI tick and background worker were running identical notification sync every 2 seconds, spawning duplicate tmux subprocesses. Removed foreground sync since background worker handles everything
- **Excessive tmux subprocess spawns**: `GetEnvironment()` spawned `tmux show-environment` every 2 seconds per Claude session for session ID lookup. Added 30-second cache since session IDs rarely change
- **Unnecessary idle session polling**: Claude/Gemini/Codex session tracking updates now skip idle sessions where nothing changes

### Added

- Configurable pattern detection system: `ResolvedPatterns` with compiled regexes replaces hardcoded busy/prompt detection, enabling pattern overrides via `config.toml`

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **MCP socket proxy 64KB crash**: `bufio.Scanner` default 64KB limit caused socket proxy to crash when MCPs like context7 or firecrawl returned large responses. Increased buffer to 10MB, preventing orphaned MCP processes and permanent "failed" status
- **Faster MCP failure recovery**: Health monitor interval reduced from 10s to 3s for quicker detection and restart of failed proxies
- **Active client disconnect on proxy failure**: When socket proxy dies, all connected clients are now actively closed so reconnecting proxies detect failure immediately instead of hanging

### Added

- **Reconnecting MCP proxy** (`agent-deck mcp-proxy`): New subcommand replaces `nc -U` as the stdio bridge to MCP sockets. Automatically reconnects with exponential backoff when sockets drop, making MCP pool restarts invisible to Claude sessions (~3s recovery)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Fork worktree isolation**: Fork dialog (`F` key) now includes an opt-in worktree toggle for git repos. When enabled, the forked session gets its own git worktree directory, isolating Claude Code project state (plan, memory, attachments) between parent and fork (#123)
- Auto-suggested branch name (`fork/<session-name>`) in fork dialog when worktree is enabled
- CLI `session fork` command gains `-w/--worktree <branch>` and `-b/--new-branch` flags for worktree-based forks
- Branch validation in fork dialog using existing git helpers

## [0.8.99] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **Session reorder persistence**: Reordering sessions with Shift+K/J now persists across reloads. Added `Order` field to session instances, normalized on every move, and sorted by Order on load. Legacy sessions (no Order field) preserve their original order via stable sort (#119)

## [0.8.98] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Claude Code 2.1.25+ busy detection**: Claude Code 2.1.25 removed `"ctrl+c to interrupt"` from the status line, causing all sessions to appear YELLOW/GRAY instead of GREEN while working. Detection now uses the unicode ellipsis (`…`) pattern: active state shows `"✳ Gusting… (35s · ↑ 673 tokens)"`, done state shows `"✻ Worked for 54s"` (no ellipsis)
- Status line token format detection updated to match new `↑`/`↓` arrow format (`(35s · ↑ 673 tokens)`)
- Content normalization updated for asterisk spinner characters (`·✳✽✶✻✢`) to prevent false hash changes

### Changed

- Analytics preview panel now defaults to OFF (opt-in via `show_analytics = true` in config.toml)

### Added

- 6 new whimsical thinking words: `billowing`, `gusting`, `metamorphosing`, `sublimating`, `recombobulating`, `sautéing`
- Word-list-independent spinner detection regex for future-proofing against new Claude Code words

## [0.8.97] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

- **CLI session ID capture**: `session start`, `session restart`, `session fork`, and `try` now persist Claude session IDs to JSON immediately, enabling fork and resume from CLI-only workflows without the TUI
- Fork pre-check recovery: `session fork` attempts to recover missing session IDs from tmux before failing, fixing sessions started before this fix
- Stale comment in `loadSessionData` corrected to reflect lazy loading behavior

### Added

- `PostStartSync()` method on Instance for synchronous session ID capture after Start/Restart (CLI-only; TUI uses its existing background worker)

## [0.8.96] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **HTTP Transport Support for MCP Servers**: Native support for HTTP/SSE MCP servers with auto-start capability
- Add `[mcps.X.server]` config block for auto-starting HTTP MCP servers (command, args, env, startup_timeout, health_check)
- Add `mcp server` CLI commands: `start`, `stop`, `status` for managing HTTP MCP servers
- Add transport type indicators in `mcp list`: `[S]`=stdio, `[H]`=http, `[E]`=sse
- Add TUI MCP dialog transport indicators with status: `●`=running, `○`=external, `✗`=stopped
- Add HTTP server pool with health monitoring and automatic restart of failed servers
- External server detection: if URL is already reachable, use it without spawning a new process

### Changed

- MCP dialog now shows transport type and server status for each MCP
- `mcp list` output now includes transport type column

## [0.8.95] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **Performance: TUI startup ~3x faster** (6s → 2s for 44 sessions)
- Batch tmux operations: ConfigureStatusBar (5→1 call), EnableMouseMode (6→2 calls) using command chaining
- Lazy loading: defer non-essential tmux configuration until first attach or background tick
- Skip UpdateStatus and session ID sync at load time (use cached status from JSON)

### Added

- Add `ReconnectSessionLazy()` for deferred session configuration
- Add `EnsureConfigured()` method for on-demand tmux setup
- Add `SyncSessionIDsToTmux()` method for on-demand session ID sync
- Background worker gradually configures unconfigured sessions (one per 2s tick)

## [0.8.94] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- Add undo delete (Ctrl+Z) for sessions: press Ctrl+Z after deleting a session to restore it including AI conversation resume. Supports multiple undos in reverse order (stack of up to 10)
- Show ^Z Undo hint in help bar (compact and full modes) when undo stack is non-empty
- Add Ctrl+Z entry to help overlay (? screen)

### Changed

- Update delete confirmation dialog: "This cannot be undone" → "Press Ctrl+Z after deletion to undo"

## [0.8.93] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix `g` key unable to create root-level groups when any group exists (#111). Add Tab toggle in the create-group dialog to switch between Root and Subgroup modes
- Fix `n` key handler using display name constant instead of path constant for default group

### Added

- Group DefaultPath tracking: groups now track the most recently accessed session's project path via `updateGroupDefaultPath`

## [0.8.92] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix CI test failure in `TestBindUnbindKey` by making default key restore best-effort in `UnbindKey`

## [0.8.91] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix TUI cursor not following notification bar session switch after detach (Ctrl+b N during attach now moves cursor to the switched-to session on Ctrl+Q)

## [0.8.90] - 2026-01-28
