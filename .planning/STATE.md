# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** After v1.5.2, SSH logout on Linux+systemd must not kill any agent-deck tmux server, and restarting any dead session must resume the prior Claude conversation — both permanently test-gated.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Persistence test scaffolding (RED)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Persistence test scaffolding (RED))
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-14 -- Phase 2 planning complete

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: — min

| 1. Persistence test scaffolding (RED) | 0/TBD | 0m | — |
| 2. Cgroup isolation default (REQ-1 fix) | 0/TBD | 0m | — |
| 3. Resume-on-start and error-recovery (REQ-2 fix) | 0/TBD | 0m | — |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Default `launch_in_user_scope=true` on Linux+systemd without a wizard prompt — silent runtime default, explicit opt-out still honored.
- No config auto-upgrade rewriting `~/.agent-deck/config.toml` — runtime-only default is sufficient.
- Gate every PR on the eight `TestPersistence_*` tests + `scripts/verify-session-persistence.sh` via the CLAUDE.md mandate — third recurrence of the same incident class, per-PR hard gate is the only prevention.
- Do not migrate the 33 error / 39 stopped sessions on the conductor host — separate manual operator task.
- Do not resume the legacy v15 roadmap in `.planning.legacy-v15/` — out of scope per PROJECT.md.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. Spec is authoritative; requirements are atomic and testable; CLAUDE.md mandate section already exists at commit a262c6d and will be audited in Phase 4.
