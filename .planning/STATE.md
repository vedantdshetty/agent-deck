# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** After v1.5.2, SSH logout on Linux+systemd must not kill any agent-deck tmux server, and restarting any dead session must resume the prior Claude conversation — both permanently test-gated.
**Current focus:** v1.5.2 milestone complete on branch fix/session-persistence — awaiting user sign-off (no push/tag/PR allowed).

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (verification-harness-docs-and-ci-wiring) — COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Phase 04 complete — v1.5.2 shippable pending user sign-off
Last activity: 2026-04-15 -- Phase 04 complete — scripts/verify-session-persistence.sh PASS, CI workflow landed

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Default `launch_in_user_scope=true` on Linux+systemd without a wizard prompt — silent runtime default, explicit opt-out still honored.
- No config auto-upgrade rewriting `~/.agent-deck/config.toml` — runtime-only default is sufficient.
- Gate every PR on the eight `TestPersistence_*` tests + `scripts/verify-session-persistence.sh` via the CLAUDE.md mandate — third recurrence of the same incident class, per-PR hard gate is the only prevention.
- Do not migrate the 33 error / 39 stopped sessions on the conductor host — separate manual operator task.
- Do not resume the legacy v15 roadmap in `.planning.legacy-v15/` — out of scope per PROJECT.md.
- Phase 03: routed Start() and StartWithMessage() through buildClaudeResumeCommand when ClaudeSessionID != "" — closed the 2026-04-14 f1e103df/b9403638 divergence. OBS-02 per-call audit line landed. docs/session-id-lifecycle.md gained a Start / Restart Dispatch subsection (PERSIST-10).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. Spec is authoritative; requirements are atomic and testable; CLAUDE.md mandate section already exists at commit a262c6d and will be audited in Phase 4.

## Session Continuity

Stopped at: Phase 04 fully landed. v1.5.2 milestone complete. Next step: user sign-off + manual SSH-logout verification per milestone criterion #2.
